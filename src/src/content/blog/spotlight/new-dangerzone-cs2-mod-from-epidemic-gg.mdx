## Overview

I’ve always loved the high-octane movement of the original DZ, but Epidemic has tuned the mechanics to favor aggressive play. 

They’ve managed to get the **Tablet** working with a full buy menu and airdrops, bringing back that tactical "hunter vs. hunted" feel we've been missing.

## Mod Features & Patch Progress

**Developer: [Epidemic.gg](https://epidemic.gg/)**

*Current Status: Alpha*

*Servers: 5 NA East / 5 EU / 1 OCE (Singapore)*

*Key Tech: Custom HUD, Tablet Integration, Proximity Chat*

### Recent Updates (Feb 1 - Feb 3)

| Feature | Change Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tablet** | New | Full buy menu and map functionality added via `Tab`. |
| **Movement** | Buff | Stackable Bump Mines for insane momentum. |
| **Fall Damage** | Mechanic | Zero damage when `Exojump` is equipped. |
| **Weapon Pool** | Balance | Removed Auto Snipers; added two primary weapon slots. |
| **Proximity Chat** | Social | Now enabled during active gameplay; muted in lobby. |

## Why This Version Hits Different

1. **The "More Loot" Philosophy:** The devs clearly realized that the worst part of DZ was spending five minutes looking for a P2k. Loot density has been cranked up across the board.
2. **Exojump Supremacy:** By removing fall damage for Exojump users, the verticality of the maps has finally been unlocked. You can go for those massive bump-mine plays without fearing the pavement.
3. **The Repulsor (Respawn Beacon):** Adding this to Solos is a controversial but brilliant move. It keeps the lobby populated longer and rewards players who can find a safe spot to reset.
4. **Fist Buff:** You can now break red loot boxes with your fists. It's slower than using a knife or gun, but it means you're never truly "stuck" at the start of a round.
