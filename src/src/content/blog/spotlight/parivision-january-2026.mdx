> I’m watching PARIVISION on map 3 against Spirit, currently 7–5, and I’m honestly buzzing. Win or lose, this team is proving it’s one of the most underrated stories of the season.

## Overview

PARIVISION came into BLAST Premier Bounty flying under the radar, for the most part. 

Very few have recognized the depth, discipline, and potential of this Russian lineup.

I’ve been a long-time Jame fan since the CS:GO days. 

He continues to excel at orchestrating slow defaults and mid-round reads with calm authority.

PARIVISION is looking great with a rapidly improving core—`BELCHONOKK`, `nota`, `xiELO` and the recent `zweih` acquisition.

## Coach and Team Stats

**Coach: dastan**

*Country: Kazakhstan*

*Time on team: 1 year 2 months*

*Maps coached: 350*

*Winrate: 63%*

*Trophies: 0*

Dastan’s tenure shows steady, structured improvement. No flashy trophy cabinet yet, but his systematic approach is translating into disciplined, low-variance play—a perfect foil for explosive teams like Spirit.

**Players (entire tenure stats)**

| Player     | Status  | Time on Team | Maps Played | Rating 3.0 |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| BELCHONOKK | Starter | 1y 9m        | 496         | 1.10       |
| Jame       | Starter | 1y           | 345         | 1.15       |
| nota       | Starter | 1y           | 345         | 1.06       |
| xiELO      | Starter | 7m           | 150         | 1.11       |
| zweih      | Starter | 24d          | 6           | 1.42       |

`zweih` is already making waves with his understanding of Spirit’s systems.

## Current Form

* Win streak: 2

* Win rate (last 3 months): 62.5%

PARIVISION have already upset expectations this season, taking down ENCE, Astralis.

## Why They’re Underrated

1. **Jame’s enduring poise:** Decades of experience allow him to neutralize early-round chaos and orchestrate late-round victories.

2. **Low-variance CS:** Conservative pacing, high save discipline, and methodical defaults frustrate star-heavy teams.

3. **Hidden talent:** `zweih`’s inside knowledge plus rapid integration of `xiELO` provides a strategic edge that isn’t reflected in public rankings.

4. **LAN discipline:** Historical underperformance in CIS teams often masks PARIVISION’s ability to maintain composure, even when the scoreboard looks tight.


## The Takeaway

No matter the final score tonight, this series proves what I’ve been saying all pre-season: **PARIVISION are the most underrated team in BLAST Premier Bounty Season 1**.

> Long live Jame Time.
