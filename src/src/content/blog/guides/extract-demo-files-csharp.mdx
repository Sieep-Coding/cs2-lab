> With Source 2, the format of `.dem` files has evolved, and so has the tooling required to interrogate them.

The transition to Counter-Strike 2 introduced complex systems like **sub-tick architecture** and **volumetric smoke**. While most players experience these through gameplay, we can analyze their implementation by parsing demo files—the serialized event streams of every tick in a match.

For a .NET developer, the barrier to entry for high-level game analytics has never been lower, thanks to `DemoFile.Net`.

## Why DemoFile.Net?

While Python is the standard for general data science, **DemoFile.Net** offers performance that is critical for processing large datasets of professional matches. On an M1 MacBook Pro, this library can parse a full competitive game in **1.3 seconds**.

When utilizing `ReadAllParallelAsync`, that time drops to nearly **500 milliseconds**. For a SaaS platform or a high-frequency trading bot for skins, that throughput is a massive architectural win.

## Getting Started

To begin extracting data from CS2 demos, you'll need the core parser package:

```bash
dotnet add package DemoFile.Game.Cs
```

### Example: The Kill Feed

The library provides a strongly-typed API for game events, allowing you to hook into the "Source 1" style events that still underpin the match logic.

```csharp
using DemoFile;

var demo = new CsDemoParser();

// Subscribe to player death events
demo.Source1GameEvents.PlayerDeath += e =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{e.Attacker?.PlayerName} [{e.Weapon}] {e.Player?.PlayerName}");
};

var reader = DemoFileReader.Create(demo, File.OpenRead("match.dem"));
await reader.ReadAllAsync();

```

## Quantifying Patch Notes: Movement & Velocity

In the [recent January 23rd update](https://www.google.com/search?q=/blog/cs2-patch-small), Valve tweaked landing velocity penalties. 

As engineers, we can verify this change by tracking player "Pawns" and their vertical velocity vectors across thousands of ticks.

Using the `TickEnd` event, we can capture spatial data for every player on the map:

```csharp
demo.TickEnd += (_, tick) => {
    foreach (var player in demo.Entities.Players)
    {
        if (player.Pawn is { } pawn)
        {
            var pos = pawn.CBodyComponent?.Position;
            var vel = pawn.AbsVelocity;
            // Log velocity to analyze the 'sv_legacy_jump_stamina' behavior
        }
    }
};

```

This level of detail allows us to build **Heatmaps** and **Velocity Curves** that prove exactly how much a player is slowed down after dropping from a specific height on a map like Anubis.

## Key Features for Engineers

* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux via .NET 6+.
* **Entity Updates:** Full support for tracking grenade trajectories, player positions, and equipment.
* **HTTP Broadcasts:** Capability to parse live GOTV broadcasts for real-time dashboarding.
* **Zero-Copy Logic:** Designed for minimal allocations to maintain that sub-second parsing speed.
