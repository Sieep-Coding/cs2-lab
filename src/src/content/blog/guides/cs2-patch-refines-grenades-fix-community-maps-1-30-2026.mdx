> Valve shipped a lightweight Counter-Strike 2 update focused on correcting edge-case gameplay logic, tightening community map permissions, and applying a handful of stability and performance fixes.

As with recent patches, this update favors precision and control over headline-grabbing changes but several items are relevant for competitive integrity and custom content.

## HE Grenade Damage Calculation

High-Explosive grenades that detonate **mid-air near the ground** will no longer have their damage calculated as if they exploded on the ground.

Previously, air-burst grenades close to terrain could incorrectly benefit from ground-based damage assumptions, potentially inflating damage values in rare scenarios.

This fix:

* Improves physical accuracy of grenade damage falloff
* Reduces inconsistent chip damage from near-ground air bursts
* Aligns visual detonation behavior with damage logic

For competitive play, this is a subtle but important correction that removes a small source of unintended variance.

## Sound Adjustments

Valve applied various knife sound tweaks.

While no specific details were provided, changes of this type typically involve:

* Volume normalization
* Improved spatial consistency
* Minor asset cleanup

These adjustments are unlikely to affect gameplay directly but contribute to overall audio polish and clarity.

## Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements

Several under-the-hood changes were included:

* **Performance optimizations for exploding chickens**, an edge-case interaction but one that can occur frequently on certain maps
* Fixed a map scripting issue where `Entity.SetOwner` failed when passed `undefined`
* Added a new mechanism for community maps to persist modified user settings

Community maps can now request permission to save select user settings (radar, viewmodel, safezones, etc.) using the command:

* `host_writeconfig_with_prompt`

If accepted by the player, approved settings will persist after exiting the map.

In parallel, community maps are now restricted to a **smaller, more controlled list of allowed console commands**, reducing the risk of abuse.

## Map Updates

### Stronghold

Stronghold has been updated to the latest version from the Community Workshop.

As with most workshop syncs, this likely includes a combination of bug fixes, visual adjustments, and minor scripting refinements.

## Competitive Takeaway

This update will not change metas or strategies but it meaningfully improves control:

* Grenade damage behaves more predictably
* Community maps gain safer persistence mechanisms
* Edge-case performance and scripting bugs are resolved

For competitive players the value lies in consistency. 

For map creators the new configuration safeguards and persistence options provide more flexibility without compromising player trust.
