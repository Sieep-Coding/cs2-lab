> Premier Season Four kicked off with a bang and Valve didn't shy away from making waves. 

Anubis has entered the Active Duty map pool, Train is out, and the layout changes are going to force every team to rethink their playbook.

We also got some weapon tweaks that could shift buy strategies, especially in eco rounds. Plus, jumping mechanics have been changed.

## The Anubis Shifts That Matter

The bridge drop in Middle has been repositioned toward Mid Doors, fundamentally altering how teams rotate and control the space. The orientation flip on the Middle doors themselves adds another layer of complexity to default setups and utility usage.

Bombsite B now has a hole above E-box, opening up new grenade angles and forcing CTs to rethink their positioning. This is the kind of change that separates teams that adapt quickly from those that don't.

At A Site, the crate repositioning pushes them up toward the steps, giving CTs more cover options during executes. This might seem minor, but it changes the geometry of how Ts plant and how post-plant defense plays out. Teams are going to need fresh demos and new utility lineups.

## The Weapon Meta Shift

The MP7 and MP5-SD buffs are understated but significant. 

- Slightly increased damage 
- Reduced fall-off range 
- $100 price drop (now $1,400) 

These changes make the MP7 and MP5-SD more viable in eco and force-buy rounds. 

The PP-Bizon also got the price treatment, dropping to $1,450.

> This matters most on maps where CTs stack B or where mid control hinges on early engagements. Expect to see more creative buy rounds that lean into these weapons.

## Jump Mechanics

This one's gonna flying under the radar for some but the jump changes are massive. Landing time is now calculated with 'subtick precision', and stamina no longer affects jumping and landing.

Teams that master these new jump timings will have an edge in rotations and improved flexibility when choosing an angle.

## Sound and Polish

Valve lowered audio output latency and added higher-fidelity knife and weapon draw sounds. 

Knife impact sounds now differentiate based on primary fire, alt fire, and attack direction.

## What This Means for the Pro Scene

Train's removal opens the door for Anubis to define early Season Four matchups. 

Teams that studied the layout early and adapted their utility will have a measurable advantage. 

The weapon adjustments reward aggressive early-round play and the jump changes benefit teams with players that can master the new jumping mechanics.

Which teams will pivot the fastest?
