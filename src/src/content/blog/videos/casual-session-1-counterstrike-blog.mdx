> "Logging the logic behind the lobby."

This is the first entry in a series documenting casual gameplay. 

No theory, no breakdowns, no coaching angle.

It is simply a recorded casual session: public server chaos, uneven rounds, and a few clean kills along the way. 

The goal is to archive gameplay as is without over-editing or manufactured narrative.

## What You’ll See

- Casual CS2 gameplay

- Mixed pacing and inconsistent rounds

- A handful of solid kills

The video is lightly edited to preserve the flow of the match.


### Technical Setup:
* **OS:** CachyOS (Linux)
* **Capture:** OBS Studio (NVENC)
* **Editor:** Shotcut (Proxy Workflow)
