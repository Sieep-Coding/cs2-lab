> "Logging the logic behind the lobby."

This is the first entry in a series documenting casual gameplay. 

Instead of high-energy highlights, we are focusing on positioning, crosshair placement, and how to exploit the predictable "swarm" behavior.

### Technical Setup:
* **OS:** CachyOS (Linux)
* **Capture:** OBS Studio (NVENC)
* **Editor:** Shotcut (Proxy Workflow)
