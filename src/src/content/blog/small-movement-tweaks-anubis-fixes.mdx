> Valve quietly pushed a small Counter-Strike 2 update, but it includes a movement change that competitive players should not ignore.

While this patch lacks sweeping map reworks or weapon balance shifts, it touches core gameplay systems and cleans up lingering issues—particularly on Anubis.

## Landing Velocity and Movement Penalties

Landing vertical velocity now affects landing speed penalties in a way similar to `sv_legacy_jump_stamina`.

In practical terms, this reintroduces a skill check around jumping and falling. Players dropping from higher elevations or chaining aggressive jumps will experience more pronounced slowdowns on landing.

This subtly impacts:
- Fast rotations involving drops
- Aggressive mid-round repositioning
- Jump-peek timing consistency

For professional and high-level play, this rewards cleaner movement paths and better jump discipline, especially on maps with verticality.

## VAC and Stability Fixes

Valve confirmed that a small number of users were incorrectly issued VAC bans due to an error. 

**These bans have now been reversed.**

Additional backend work includes:
- HUD safezone settings now applying correctly
- General server stability improvements

These changes are unlikely to be visible match-to-match but reduce friction during long sessions and tournament play.

## Anubis Adjustments

Anubis received another round of cleanup following its recent structural changes.

- Physics objects no longer incorrectly interact with overlapping convex water volumes
- Multiple player clipping issues have been resolved
- The radar minimap has been updated to reflect the current layout 

Incorrect clipping and outdated radar information disproportionately punish teams relying on tight timings and utility precision.

## Competitive Takeaway

The landing velocity change quietly raises the movement skill ceiling back and the Anubis fixes continue Valve’s effort to stabilize the map for long-term competitive use.

Expect no immediate shift in team strategies but expect players who cut corners in movement to feel it.
