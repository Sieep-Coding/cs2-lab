> Vitality win 2-0 over GamerLegion.

> Vitality took Inferno and Dust2.

> Nick's MVP: `Zyw0o`

## Overview

GamerLegion pushed Vitality on both maps and repeatedly built early advantages, but were unable to close key rounds once the series reached its critical moments. Vitality’s experience showed through in late halves, where structure, utility discipline, and individual composure consistently swung momentum back in their favor.

Despite strong individual numbers from GamerLegion, particularly in the opening halves, Vitality controlled the series when it mattered most and advanced with a clean 2–0.

## Map 1: Inferno

GamerLegion opened Inferno confidently on their map pick, with `hypex` finding early impact and helping the team keep pace through the first half. The opening exchanges were competitive, and GamerLegion matched Vitality round for round.

As the map progressed, Vitality adjusted their CT-side setups and denied space more effectively. `hypex` cooled off after the early success, and Vitality began to take control of late-round situations.

In the second half, `Zyw0o` and `ropz` provided consistent impact, punishing mid-round hesitation and closing out key clutches. Vitality rallied to secure Inferno 13–9, despite GamerLegion’s solid start.

## Map 2: Dust2

Dust2 began scrappy, with both teams trading force buys and early-round swings. `REZ` was dominant out of the gate, posting 13 kills in the opening nine rounds and repeatedly breaking Vitality’s defenses.

GamerLegion carried that momentum into halftime with a 7–5 lead, and a fast B-hit called by `Snax` pushed them to 10 rounds first. At 10–7, GamerLegion were firmly in control and in position to force a decider.

Vitality responded by shifting into a double AWP setup with `Zyw0o` and `ropz`, slowing the pace and denying map control. From that point forward, Vitality won the majority of late-round scenarios, converting small advantages with precision.

`Zyw0o` closed the map in decisive fashion, and Vitality completed the comeback to win Dust2 13–11, sealing the series 2–0.

Across both maps, `Zyw0o` delivered when Vitality needed stability, anchoring the comeback on Dust2 and maintaining pressure throughout Inferno.
