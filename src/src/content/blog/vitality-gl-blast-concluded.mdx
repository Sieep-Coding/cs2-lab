## Overview

GamerLegion started strong on Inferno with `hypex` delivering consistently. 

By half-time Vitality had adjusted and got back into the game and `hypex` cooled off.

Vitality rallied in the second half with impact from `Zyw0o` and `ropz`, closing out the map 13-9.

Map 2 on Dust2 starts now.
