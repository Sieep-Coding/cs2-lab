24 teams. 

$1,250,000 on the line. 

And it all starts today with a 16-team Play-In.

### The Opening Matchups (Jan 28)

| Matchup | Time (CET) | My Pick |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aurora vs GamerLegion** | 02:00 | Aurora |
| **HEROIC vs PARIVISION** | 02:00 | PARIVISION |
| **Astralis vs paiN** | 04:30 | Astralis |
| **NRG vs B8** | 04:30 | B8 |
| **Legacy vs BC.Game** | 07:00 | BC.Game |
| **FUT vs 3DMAX** | 07:00 | 3DMAX |
| **Liquid vs NiP** | 09:30 | Liquid |
| **Passion UA vs G2** | 09:30 | G2 |

## The Storylines You Can't Ignore

### 1. The Return of the King (BC.Game)

The most viewed match of the day will undoubtedly be **BC.Game vs Legacy**. Why? Because **s1mple and electronic** are finally back together on a LAN that actually matters. 

After BC.Game's disappointing run in the Rio qualifiers, s1mple needs a vintage performance to prove this project isn't just a "last dance" for the legends.

### 2. PARIVISION: From Bounty to Bosses

I just wrote about how [underrated PARIVISION is](https://counterstrike.blog/blog/spotlight/parivision-january-2026), and their opening match against **HEROIC** is the ultimate litmus test. 

Fresh off their BLAST Premier Bounty title, Jame and his crew aren't the underdogs anymore. 

Expect methodical, "Jame-time" CS that will frustrate a young HEROIC squad.

### 3. Liquid’s Family Emergency

A massive blow to the North American hopes: **NAF is missing Kraków** due to urgent family matters. 

**Krimbo** (formerly of BIG) is standing in. 

While Krimbo is a world-class anchor, losing NAF’s late-round composure is a huge "if" for a Liquid team that already struggles with closing out maps.

## Players to Watch

* **s1mple (BC.Game):** Can he still carry at the S-tier level?
* **Jame (PARIVISION):** The ultimate tactician. If PARIVISION is to upset HEROIC, it starts with Jame’s passive calling.
* **nota (PARIVISION):** The young Russian delivered a series MVP in the recent [Blast Bounty Grand Final](https://counterstrike.blog/blog/blast-bounty-2026/falcons-parivision-blast-grand-final). Can he keep it up against HEROIC?
* **malbsMd (G2):** In the post-NiKo/m0NESY era (who are already in Stage 2 with Falcons), malbsMd has become the focal point of G2's aggression.
* **npl (B8):** B8 has been grinding the tier-2 circuit for months. If npl finds his NAVI-era peak, B8 is the dark horse to qualify 2-0.

## The Takeaway

The 18+ crowd in Poland is notoriously loud and the TAURON Arena is a massive upgrade in scale. 

If you're looking for a "safer" option, look toward G2, PARIVISION, GamerLegion, Heroic or Astralis to glide through Stage 1. 

But if you want the drama, watch BC.Game.
