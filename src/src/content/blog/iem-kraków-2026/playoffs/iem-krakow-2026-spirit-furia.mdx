The TAURON Arena is set for a collision of worlds. **Spirit (#7)**, the statistical anomalies of the CIS region, face off against the resurrected Brazilian kings, **FURIA (#2)**. With a spot in the Grand Final on the line, this is the match everyone has been waiting for.

### **The Matchup**

**Time:** 09:45 CET | **Stage:** Semi-final (LAN) | **Format:** BO3

| Team | World Rank | Recent Form | Head-to-Head (Maps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spirit** | #7 | 3 Win Streak | 10 Wins |
| **FURIA** | #2 | 4 Win Streak | 4 Wins |

## **The Statistical Anomaly: donk vs. KSCERATO**

If you want to know why Spirit is the slight favorite (55.1%) despite their lower ranking, look no further than **donk**. His numbers over the past three months aren't just good; they are historic.

| Stat (Past 3 Months) | **donk** (Spirit) | **KSCERATO** (FURIA) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rating** | 1.43 | 1.19 |
| **Kills Per Round** | 0.93 | 0.72 |
| **ADR** | 97.0 | 78.1 |
| **Multi-kill Rating** | 1.56 | 1.08 |

**donk** is currently averaging nearly one kill every single round. To counter this, FURIA will rely on **KSCERATO’s** legendary positioning and **FalleN’s** veteran AWPing to shut down the entry duels before the 18-year-old can take over the site.

## **The Map Battlefield**

While the final veto is TBA, the recent win rates suggest a high-octane series.

* **Dust2:** Both teams are monsters here. Spirit holds an 80% win rate (10 maps), while FURIA sits at 83% (6 maps). If this is Map 1, expect a fireworks show.
* **The Nuke Factor:** FURIA is nearly unbeatable on Nuke recently with an **88% win rate**. Spirit has struggled here (50%), making it a likely pick for the Brazilians.
* **Inferno:** A massive advantage for FURIA. They have played it 10 times recently with a 70% success rate; Spirit hasn't recorded a single official map on it in the last 3 months.

## **Key Storylines**

### **1. The sh1ro vs. FalleN Duel**

This is a battle of the AWP generations. **sh1ro** represents the ultra-efficient, low-mistake style of modern CS, while **FalleN** is the "Godfather" of Brazilian CS, playing with a renewed aggression that has powered FURIA to World #2.

### **2. Spirit’s Triple Threat**

While donk gets the headlines, the supporting cast of **sh1ro** and **zont1x** makes Spirit a nightmare to prepare for. If FURIA over-invests utility to stop donk, zont1x has proven he can anchor sites solo with a high KAST.

### **3. The Momentum War**

FURIA is on a "miracle run" style streak, recently taking down Vitality and G2. Spirit, however, holds the historical edge in the Head-to-Head (10-4). The Brazilians need to break the "Spirit Curse" to reach their first Major-scale final of 2026.

---

## **The Takeaway**

Spirit has the higher peak firepower, but FURIA is playing the most cohesive Counter-Strike we've seen from them in years. If the Brazilians can ban out Spirit’s comfort on Dust2 or Ancient, their deep map pool on Inferno and Nuke should see them through.

**My Pick:** **Spirit 2-1** (donk's raw impact is simply too high to bet against in a Semi-final atmosphere).
