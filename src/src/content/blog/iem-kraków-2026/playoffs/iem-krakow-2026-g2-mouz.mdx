The second Quarter-final of **IEM Kraków 2026** is a clash of two European titans moving in different directions. **MOUZ (#4)** enters as the steady, tactical machine, while **G2 (#10)** is still finding its identity after the post-Major roster shuffle.

### **Match Details**

## **The Veto: Strategic Chess**

The map pool for this series is fascinating. MOUZ has targeted **Overpass**, a map where G2 has struggled significantly (33% win rate), while G2 is leaning on the individual heroics possible on **Dust2**.

1. **MOUZ removed Anubis**
2. **G2 removed Nuke**
3. **MOUZ picked Overpass** (G2's weak link)
4. **G2 picked Dust2** (MOUZ's 67% win rate vs G2's comfort)
5. **Mirage was left over** (The Decider)

## **Battle of the Stars: HeavyGod vs. xertioN**

The statistical mirror between these two entry-fraggers is uncanny. Both are pillars of their respective teams, providing the opening impact needed to break sites.

| Stat (Past 3 Months) | **HeavyGod** (G2) | **xertioN** (MOUZ) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rating** | 1.11 | 1.11 |
| **Kills Per Round** | 0.71 | 0.73 |
| **ADR** | 77.8 | 82.7 |
| **KAST** | 73.9% | 73.9% |

## **The Storylines**

### **1. The MOUZ Mental Block**

Looking at the Head-to-Head history, G2 has a massive mountain to climb. In their last seven maps played against each other across 2025, **MOUZ has won six**. G2’s only victory was a narrow 13-11 on Inferno. Can **SunPayus** and **MATYS** change the narrative?

### **2. The Spinx Factor**

MOUZ's addition of **Spinx** has given them a late-round composure that G2 currently lacks. While **huNter-** remains a veteran presence for G2, the tactical depth of the MOUZ lineup (featuring **Jimpphat** and **torzsi**) often overwhelms G2’s "star-power" approach.

### **3. The Mirage Decider**

If this series goes to Map 3, G2 actually holds the statistical advantage. They boast a **75% win rate** on Mirage over the last 3 months, whereas MOUZ has struggled at **25%**.

> **Crucial Note:** For G2 to win, they *must* survive the MOUZ pick of Overpass and push it to the decider.

## **The Takeaway**

MOUZ is the more "complete" team, but G2 is the more dangerous one when their backs are against the wall. The public slightly favors G2 (51.9%), likely betting on the high ceiling of **malbsMd** and **SunPayus** in a playoff environment. However, history favors the young mice of MOUZ.

**My Pick:** **MOUZ 2-1** (Winning Overpass and a close Dust2).
