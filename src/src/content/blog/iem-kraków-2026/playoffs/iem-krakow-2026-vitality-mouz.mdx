The second Semi-final of **IEM Kraków 2026** is a heavyweight clash with a lopsided history. **Vitality (#1)** enters as the overwhelming community favorite (75% win probability) against a **MOUZ (#4)** side that has consistently struggled to finish off the French organization in high-pressure scenarios.

### **Match Details**

**Time:** 13:00 CET | **Stage:** Semi-final (LAN) | **Format:** BO3

| Team | World Rank | Recent Form | H2H (Maps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vitality** | #1 | 3 Match Win Streak | 29 Wins |
| **MOUZ** | #4 | 3 Match Win Streak | 14 Wins |

## **The GOAT Factor: ZywOo vs. xertioN**

While **ropz** has been a solid addition to the Vitality core, the spotlight remains firmly on **ZywOo**. His statistical dominance over the last three months is the primary reason MOUZ faces such an uphill battle.

| Stat (Past 3 Months) | **ZywOo** (Vitality) | **xertioN** (MOUZ) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rating** | 1.31 | 1.10 |
| **KAST** | 75.1% | 73.6% |
| **Round Swing** | +3.67% | +0.07% |
| **Multi-kill Rating** | 1.28 | 1.10 |

**ZywOo's** +3.67% round swing impact is massive—it essentially means he single-handedly flips almost 4 out of every 100 rounds that Vitality should otherwise lose.

## **Map Pool: The Overpass/Dust2 Deadlock**

Both teams share very similar strengths in the current rotation, which makes the veto phase critical.

* **Dust2:** Vitality is nearly perfect here (**88% win rate** over 8 maps). MOUZ is also strong (75%), but they might avoid this against ZywOo's AWP.
* **Overpass:** A shared comfort zone. Both teams boast a massive win rate (88% for Vitality, 75% for MOUZ). Expect this to be Map 1 or Map 2.
* **Mirage:** This is MOUZ’s Achilles' heel. They have a dismal **25% win rate** on Mirage, while Vitality sits at a comfortable **80%**. If this map appears, the series is likely over.

## **Key Storylines**

### **1. The ropz Revenge Tour**

Since moving to Vitality, **ropz** has found a new level of consistency under **apEX’s** calling. Facing his former organization in a Semi-final adds an extra layer of psychological pressure. Will he play the "lurker" role to perfection, or will his former teammates know his timings too well?

### **2. Can MOUZ Finish?**

History is littered with MOUZ taking maps off Vitality (like the 22-19 Inferno thriller in Chengdu) but failing to close the series. **Jimpphat** and **Spinx** need to provide world-class anchoring to prevent Vitality from mounting the second-half comebacks they are famous for.

### **3. The apEX vs. siuhy Mind Game**

The veteran vs. the protégé. apEX’s emotional, high-energy style often rattles younger teams, whereas MOUZ thrives when the game stays tactical. If apEX can force a "brawl" style of CS, Vitality’s individual mechanics will likely prevail.

## **The Takeaway**

Vitality is the world #1 for a reason. They have better individual stats, a deeper map pool, and a historical psychological edge over MOUZ (29 wins to 14). For MOUZ to win, they need **torzsi** to out-AWP ZywOo—a feat very few have accomplished in 2026.

**My Pick:** **Vitality 2-0** (Winning Overpass and a dominant Mirage).
