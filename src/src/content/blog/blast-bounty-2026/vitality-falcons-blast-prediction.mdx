> This is not a rivalry match. This is a stress test.

Vitality are controlling series from the veto onward. 

Falcons remain a high-ceiling, low-margin team that relies heavily on individual overperformance.

This dynamic matters a lot on LAN.

## Overview

I am estimating **Vitality 61% / Falcons 39%**.

This number reflects depth and veto leverage more than raw star power.

Falcons can win this series but only through specific map outcomes.

## The Map Pool: Structural Edge for Vitality

Vitality strengths (past 3 months):

- Dust2: 88% (8 maps)  
- Mirage: 100% (6 maps)  
- Inferno: 64% (11 maps)  
- Nuke: 67% (9 maps)

Falcons strengths:

- Dust2: 80% (5 maps)  
- Mirage: 78% (9 maps)  
- Nuke: 71% (7 maps)

Key issues for Falcons:

- No reliable Overpass  
- Limited Ancient exposure  
- Inferno is playable, not dominant  

Likely veto flow pushes this toward **Dust2 / Mirage / Inferno**, which favors Vitality’s consistency rather than Falcons’ volatility.

## ZywOo vs m0NESY Is Not the Real Battle

The headline duel matters, but it is not decisive.

Over the last three months:

**ZywOo**
- 1.31 rating
- +3.79% round swing
- Higher late-round conversion

**m0NESY**
- 1.34 rating
- +3.76% round swing
- Higher opening duel impact

The difference is what happens *after* contact.

Vitality convert advantages more reliably. 

Falcons often need multi-kill rounds to stabilize their economy.

`NiKo` is the multi-kill X-factor, but he cannot carry alone in terms of rifling against a team like Vitality.

## Falcons’ Win Condition Is Narrow

For Falcons to win:

- NiKo must consistently outperform ropz  
- m0NESY must maintain opening success across all maps  
- kyxsan and NucleonZ must focus on surviving CT halves without hemorrhaging utility  

That is a demanding checklist against the most disciplined team in the event.

## LAN Context

On LAN:

- Vitality suppress momentum better than any team in Europe  
- apEX-led sides rarely collapse after losing pistol rounds  
- Falcons’ losses tend to escalate once economy pressure builds  

A Falcons win is possible but rarely clean.

## Angles That Make Sense

- **Vitality to win**
- **Over 2.5 maps**
- **Falcons to win a map** (Dust2 most likely)

Vitality 2–0 requires Falcons to lose Dust2 or Mirage — not the median outcome.

## Prediction

Falcons will create pressure early, especially on Dust2.

But across a full BO3, Vitality’s structure, depth, and mid-round control should prevail.

**Prediction: Vitality win 2–1.**
