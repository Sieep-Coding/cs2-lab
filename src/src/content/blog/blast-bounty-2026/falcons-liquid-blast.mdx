> This is the kind of matchup the Bounty format was designed to surface: raw firepower versus structure, confidence versus control.

Team Falcons arrive as the higher-ranked squad with a deeper recent win rate across key maps. Team Liquid arrive battle-tested from the play-ins, already comfortable under LAN pressure, and playing looser because the bounty burden is not theirs to protect.

On paper, this should be close. In practice, the margins are razor thin.

## The Map Pool Tells a Story

Both teams share strength across the core competitive pool, but their weaknesses do not overlap cleanly.

**Falcons** are strongest on:

* Dust2 (75% win rate)
* Mirage (66.7%)
* Inferno and Nuke (both 62.5%)

**Liquid** show their edge on:

* Nuke (80%)
* Inferno (66.7%)
* Mirage (60%)

Neither team has shown Anubis or Overpass, which simplifies the veto and pushes this series into comfort territory rather than experimentation.

This likely means:

* Mirage or Inferno as a contested opener
* Nuke almost guaranteed to appear
* Dust2 heavily favors Falcons if it gets through

> The veto phase will matter more than usual because both teams want similar maps for very different reasons.

## Falcons: Firepower First, Questions Second

Falcons are built to overwhelm.

m0NESY and NiKo provide round-winning potential with minimal setup, and when the opening duels go their way, Falcons can snowball halves quickly. Their recent 3–2 form reflects volatility rather than weakness.

However, there is a recurring pattern:

* Strong starts
* Occasional mid-round hesitation
* Reliance on individual conversion late in halves

On LAN, that becomes a risk. If early momentum stalls, Falcons must prove they can grind out structured rounds rather than forcing them.

## Liquid: Slower, But More Cohesive

Liquid’s recent record does not inspire confidence at a glance, but context matters.

They have already survived elimination pressure, and their wins have come through adaptation rather than dominance. siuhy’s calling emphasizes late-round clarity, and NAF remains one of the most reliable anchors on LAN.

Liquid’s problems show up when:

* Early-round space is lost repeatedly
* Dust2 enters the pool
* They are forced into constant retakes

If they can keep the economy stable and avoid prolonged CT-side droughts, they can absolutely take this series deep.

## The Deciding Factors

This series will likely hinge on three variables:

1. **Opening duels**
   If Falcons consistently win early fights, Liquid will struggle to establish defaults.

2. **Mid-round discipline on Nuke**
   Both teams are strong here, but Liquid’s structure gives them a slight edge in slower rounds.

3. **Mental response to momentum swings**
   The bounty system amplifies every lost map. The team that resets faster wins the series.

## Prediction

**Prediction: Team Falcons win 2–1**, with Liquid taking one map through superior mid-round control before Falcons close it out on raw firepower.
