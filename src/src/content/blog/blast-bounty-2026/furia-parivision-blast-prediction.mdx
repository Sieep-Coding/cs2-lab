> FURIA are favored by reputation. PARIVISION are favored by structure.

This series will not be fast.

PARIVISION deliberately slow games down, and FURIA’s weakest performances this season have come when tempo is taken out of their hands.

## Overview

I am estimating **FURIA 55% / PARIVISION 45%**.

That spread is narrow given the ranking gap.

## The Map Pool: Where PARIVISION Competes

PARIVISION strengths (past 3 months):

- Dust2: 100% (5 maps)  
- Mirage: 67% (6 maps)  
- Overpass: 67% (6 maps)  
- Ancient: 80% (10 maps)

FURIA strengths:

- Dust2: 100% (4 maps)  
- Inferno: 75% (8 maps)  
- Nuke: 83% (6 maps)  
- Overpass: 71% (7 maps)

Critical dynamics:

- PARIVISION will remove Nuke  
- Inferno heavily favors FURIA  
- Ancient and Mirage lean PARIVISION  
- Dust2 becomes a high-variance neutralizer  

This series likely goes **three maps unless FURIA dominate Inferno**.

## Jame vs FURIA’s Aggression

This matchup revolves around **Jame’s economy control**.

PARIVISION:

- Save aggressively  
- Rebuy conservatively  
- Play for late-round advantages  

FURIA:

- Take early space  
- Accept economic risk  
- Rely on aim pressure to snowball  

When early aggression fails, FURIA’s mid-round structure becomes inconsistent.

## Star Power Comparison

FURIA’s edge:

- molodoy and KSCERATO provide higher fragging ceilings  
- YEKINDAR adds volatility on T sides, played under Jame.

PARIVISION’s edge:

- More even frag distribution  
- Fewer low-impact rounds from support roles  
- Better post-plant discipline
- PARIVISION played yesterday unlike FURIA

This matters more on LAN than online.

## LAN Context

On LAN:

- Jame-led teams historically outperform market expectations  
- PARIVISION rarely get swept  
- FURIA’s losses skew toward long, grind-heavy BO3s  

A FURIA win does not imply control.

## Angles That Make Sense

- **Over 2.5 maps**
- **PARIVISION +1.5 maps**
- **PARIVISION to win a map** (Ancient or Mirage)

FURIA 2–0 requires clean Inferno dominance and Dust2 control — a demanding path.

## Prediction

FURIA have more raw firepower and should be favored to advance.

But PARIVISION’s veto leverage, LAN discipline, and economy control suggest a long series.

**Prediction: FURIA win 2–1.**
