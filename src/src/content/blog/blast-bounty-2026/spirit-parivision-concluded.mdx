## Overview
A high-stakes CIS derby on LAN, defined by veto pressure, star impact, and momentum swings across the map pool.

## Map 1: Overpass
Spirit start strong with a 7-4 lead on CT side. `magixx` and `donk` consistently holding the B site.

PARIVISION have been able to crack the site a few times, and `Jame` delivered a huge 1v2 clutch to keep them in the game.

`zweih` has been quiet.

Second half starts 8-4 to Spirit.

Spirit completely dominate their T side, closing out the map 13-5. 

`magixx` IGLing is working perfectly on LAN against a top team so far. 

`tN1R` is proving why he should be over `zweih` in the starting lineup.

## Map 2: Mirage

The first half was even with `magixx` continuing his strong form and `zont1x` stepping up.

For PARIVISION, `zweih` is starting to find his rhythm, and `Jame` is making key plays.

The second half has started 7-7 with each team trading rounds.

PARIVISION hit 12 rounds first with Spirit at 9. 

`xIELO` pulls a rabbit out of his hat in a 2v5 clutch to bring PARIVISION the win.

## Map 3: Ancient
Map 3 starts with Spirit taking an early lead, but PARIVISION respond quickly.

The score sits at 5-5 as Spirit burn through timeouts and `donl` showing visible frustration.

`Jame` is playing well and has `donk`'s number.

PARIVISION bring it hard on defense and bring it home for 13-8 win.

`magixx` had a solid series individually but his IGLing showed cracks under pressure.

Spirit seemed lost and unable to adapt to `Jame`'s mid-round calls.
