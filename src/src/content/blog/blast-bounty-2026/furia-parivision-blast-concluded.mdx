## Overview

This series will not be fast. 

PARIVISION deliberately slow games down, and FURIA’s weakest performances this season have come when tempo is taken out of their hands.

Updates will be provided map by map as the series progresses.

## Map 1: Mirage
PARIVISION don't look great on the T side to start as FURIA take an early lead. It is 4-0 in favor of FURIA.

Jame's strong leadership and BELCHONOKK's fragging are on display as PARIVISION claw back to make it 6-6 at halftime.

The second half is a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading rounds leaving it tied at 8-8.

PARIVISION's disciplined playstyle starts to pay off as they take control of the game and pull ahead at 12-8.

xiELO shines with some crucial kills and ends with 20 frags, as PARIVISION close out the map 13-8.

## Map 2: Inferno
Furia have started strong with YEKINDAR leading the charge. 

Second half, it's 9-7 in favor of FURIA as PARIVISION start to show life through BELCHONOKK and Jame again.

FURIA's T side hits banana successfully to reach double digits first but PARIVISION are not far behind at 10-9.

It's a nailbiter as PARIVISION hit 12 rounds first.
