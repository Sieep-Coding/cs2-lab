## Overview

Liquid were able to bring map 1 into overtime, a promising sign as the team continues a decent run of form. 

With solid performances from `EliGE` (86 ADR) & `NertZ` (88 ADR), Liquid were unable to close in map 1.

In map 2 of Dust 2, no one posted over 20 frags for Liquid as `m0nesy` drops back to back 20+ kill games.

Despite their best efforts, it was `m0nesy` who stole the show. Posting 116 ADR and 50 frags across the two maps of Nuke and Dust2.
