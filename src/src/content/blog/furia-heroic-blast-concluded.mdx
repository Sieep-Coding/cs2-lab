> HEROIC took Mirage; FURIA answered on Dust2 and Nuke.

> Nick's MVP: `molodoy`

## Overview

HEROIC opened the series with a statement on Mirage, winning 13–3 on their own pick. I was a little shocked but thought the momentum would carry them over the finish line in map 2 or 3.

Their CT-side setups were decisive, limiting FURIA to only three rounds and punishing early-round aggression. 

`xfl0ud` led the way for HEROIC on the opener, finishing the map with strong efficiency and impact.

The series shifted sharply on Dust2. FURIA’s T-side pacing and mid-round decisiveness dismantled HEROIC’s defenses, resulting in a one-sided 13–2 response. `molodoy` immediately took control, finding opening picks and converting advantages at a high rate. HEROIC struggled to establish economy or trading structure, winning only two rounds total.

Nuke proved more competitive but followed a familiar trend. 

FURIA built a solid CT half and maintained composure in late-round situations. 

HEROIC showed resistance, but lacked closing power in key gun rounds. `molodoy` remained the difference-maker, combining AWP impact with consistent rifle damage to shut down HEROIC’s comeback attempts.

Across all three maps, `molodoy` finished with:

* **47 kills**
* **91.2 ADR**
* **88.7% KAST**
* **1.62 Rating**

HEROIC won the opener convincingly, but FURIA’s depth, structure, and star power carried them through the series. 

The result reinforces FURIA’s LAN reliability while HEROIC leave with positives from Mirage but clear gaps to address in mid-series adaptation.
